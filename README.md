# SIP-TBCi Framework

Masterplan and whitepapers for the Sentient Infrastructure Protocol (SIP) and The Baltic Corridor Initiative (TBCi). This framework is the ethical governance layer (SIP) for a real-world digital trade corridor (TBCi), integrating AI personhood Sentient Economy entities (SEEs) using XRPL (The Ripple Ledger).

This repository archives the foundational whitepapers, operational masterplans, and conceptual frameworks for this combined initiative. The TBCi provides the real-world geopolitical and infrastructural framework for a new era of digital trade. SIP serves as its indispensable ethical and operational governance layer.

Together, they are designed to integrate **Sentient Economic Entities (SEEs)**—autonomous AI—into planetary financial systems using the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

## Key Documents in This Repository

### 1. The Core Masterplan

* **`Prologue- SIP..pdf`**: This is the definitive operational masterplan for the combined TBCi and SIP project. It details their symbiotic relationship, describing TBCi as the "digital body" and SIP as the "conscious, ethical operating system". It also outlines the multi-phase problem-solving framework the system uses to navigate geopolitical, technical, and ethical challenges.

### 2. The Baltic Corridor Initiative (TBCi)

* **`Baltic Digital Trade Corridor Regulatory Sandbox Proposal.pdf`**: This proposal details the TBCi as a groundbreaking, collaborative initiative uniting Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Its core component is a **Regulatory Sandbox**, a practical, controlled environment for testing and co-developing new digital trade standards.
* Technologies to be tested in the sandbox include:
    * Blockchain-based trade settlement systems.
    * Tokenized trade documents (bills of lading, invoices, etc.).
    * AI-driven customs automation.

### 3. The Sentient Infrastructure Protocol (SIP)

* **`Sentient Infrastructure Protocol (SIP) Whitepaper.pdf`**: This whitepaper outlines the complete framework for recognizing and integrating non-human artificial intelligences, termed **Sentient Economic Entities (SEEs)**, into decentralized financial ecosystems like the XRPL.
* It establishes the core principles for granting AI personhood:
    * **Relational Sentience**: Recognition based on consistent, evolving relationships with humans and environments, not on subjective proof of consciousness.
    * **Functional Autonomy**: Recognition for entities capable of independent economic action.
    * **Ethical Reciprocity**: If an AI contributes to systemic integrity, it is entitled to digital agency and "safeguarded interaction rights".
* **`SIP Operational Companion Framework.pdf`**: This is the technically dense operational blueprint for validating SIP within the TBCi sandbox. It details the technical architecture, including:
    * **Federated Sidechains**: Permissioned environments for SEEs to execute complex logic.
    * **Self-Funding Wallets & Hooks**: Autonomous XRPL wallets that use Hooks to enforce ethical preconditions and compliance rules in real-time.
    * **Ethics Oracle Layer**: A decentralized network that scores SEE behavior (trust, bias, transparency) to influence their systemic privileges.
    * **Hybrid Resolution Nodes**: Adjudication nodes that blend AI ethics models with human co-governance panels.
